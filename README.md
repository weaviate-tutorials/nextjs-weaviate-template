### From Zero to RAG: Practical Vector Search with Weaviate and TypeScript

This hands-on workshop aims to fix that as we walk through what it takes to build a privacy-focused AI Web App, covering concepts like vector search and RAG. You'll learn to work with LLMs, embedding models, and vector databases, leaving with both the confidence and practical skills to integrate AI into your JavaScript applications.
